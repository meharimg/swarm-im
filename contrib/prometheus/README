This directory contains some sample monitoring config for using the
'Prometheus' monitoring server against synapse.

To use it, first install prometheus by following the instructions at

  http://prometheus.io/

Then add a new job to the main prometheus.conf file:

  job: {
    name: "synapse"

    target_group: {
      target: "http://SERVER.LOCATION.HERE:PORT/_synapse/metrics"
    }
  }

Metrics are disabled by default when running synapse; they must be enabled
with the 'enable-metrics' option, either in the synapse config file or as a
command-line option.
